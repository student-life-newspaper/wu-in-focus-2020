<p>In 2015, Washington University appeared in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/16/upshot/washington-university-aims-to-attract-low-income-students.html">New York Times</a> in an article that highlighted the lack of socioeconomic diversity at the University, while also showcasing the isolation that students from a lower socioeconomic background on campus endure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this, the University realized it was time to put significant effort into changing the situation. Assistant Dean for Student Success Harvey Fields was placed on an advisory committee for the problem after his experience serving as director of TRIO and as a retention and academic advisor in Cornerstone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of people have talked about what we need to do, the chancellor [and] provost decided we needed to challenge ourselves to increase that number [of students from a lower socioeconomic background],&rdquo; Fields said. &ldquo;But we need to make sure that the institutional culture is such that they can thrive here and not...just be here...The need to have a structure that demonstrated that this was a strategic priority at the University and something that would be continued, not the flavor of the month, if you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Assistant Provost for Student Success Anthony Tillman arrived at the University in July 2016 as the University began to allocate resources towards increasing the number of Pell-eligible students and creating a welcoming environment for those students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the sentiment of wanting to include and bring in Pell-eligible students was clear, the plan to accomplish it was not. Tillman discussed how he could have spent his entire first year at the University researching and planning. However, the previous year had the highest number of Pell-eligible students of any year and 2016 was set to have an even higher number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn't want to wait and have another class go through a year of not being supported and not being...helped to build community and move forward in that regard,&rdquo; Tillman said. &ldquo;I didn't want them to not get off on a good start in terms of having an enriching and fulfilling academic experience or educational experience here at Wash. U...I didn't want to have another year of what I call collateral damage, because we didn't have anything in place to support these students.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, after much planning between Tillman and Fields, the Deneb community was made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Fields, the name &ldquo;Deneb&rdquo; came from Tillman&rsquo;s view of how attending an elite school like Wash. U., for many students coming from low socioeconomic backgrounds, could feel like a far-reaching dream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's like a dim thing out there that you can aspire to. But now with the commitment of the University, it has become more of a reality,&rdquo; Fields said. &ldquo;Turns out that one of the further stars that supposedly can be seen by the naked human eye is Deneb, itself a star.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The students aren't broken... you do not need to be fixed. You are not coming in damaged,&rdquo; Tillman said. &ldquo;We didn't do you a favor by admitting you to this university. You will bring into us all the riches that you brought with you, and you're going to add to us while we add to you. So that's where this name came from. We didn't need to fix you. We needed to help you sustain yourself at the University.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And thus, Deneb STARS was born.</p>
<p>As the Deneb class of 2020 came in, many became aware of the lack of socioeconomic diversity within the institution at which they would be spending the next four years. Senior Lilian Velasco recalled the first time she read the New York Times article and saw the actual statistics of the lack of diversity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amongst all the times that I've felt out of place amongst my peers because of my socioeconomic background, I've never felt more isolated and out of place than when I read that study for the first time,&rdquo; Velasco said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon seeing the divide in the backgrounds between students, it can be nearly impossible to avoid the feeling of inequality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it's very easy to revert to a lot of &lsquo;Life is not fair&rsquo; sentiments,&rdquo; senior David Leon said. &ldquo;That's how it's kind of been for me. I think finding out that, a lot of students don't have to go through the same problems or have better and more resources...at their disposal, that's just kind of when you have feelings of like, &lsquo;Oh, I have to do a lot better, I have to try a lot harder to just get on a level playing field with some students.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before classes started, eligible students received a letter formally inviting them to attend an event in College Hall to learn about Deneb and how it could help them reach their full academic potential at this University. Many entering the meeting did not know what Deneb was specifically, nor why precisely they had been selected for the program. However, through the following meetings information was dispersed, trust grew and a community was formed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Velasco shared how her college experience has been impacted by the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being involved with the Deneb STARS program has been one of the most influential experiences of my college career,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I would not be where I am today without this program. The opportunities that I've had to be part of a community of people from a similar background and who understand my experiences and can empathize with me has been invaluable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Senior Han Ju Seo said that she wished students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds exhibited more awareness of their privilege and the opportunities that may not have been afforded to others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think sometimes it's easy just to look at people that don't have as much and think, &lsquo;Oh, it's because they didn't do x, y and z&rsquo; and really it could be for a variety of reasons,&rdquo; Seo said. &ldquo;They just don't know someone's life and what their circumstance was...not every person has the same opportunities as you and just because they don't go to Wash. U. or whatever other big-name school doesn't mean that they're dumb or stupid or weren't good enough to get into this school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since that first year, the Deneb STARS community has grown and changed in many ways. Fields reported that this most recent class had roughly 190 students opt into the community, the largest number yet, and he expects for this number to continue to grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the community has expanded to include first generation students rather than solely those from under-resourced socioeconomic backgrounds. In order to enhance the feeling of community, Deneb also enacted an early arrival program as well as a class retreat that allows for new Denebs to become acquainted with the campus and with each other before beginning their classes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In tandem, the University also established several programs to help bridge the privilege gap, such as the WashU Pledge, the Student Union Mental Health Fund, the Student Union Opportunity Fund and the Civic Engagement Opportunity Fund. These funds all serve to make available to students what some can do without a second thought, and have proved vital to the wellbeing of many.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mental Health Fund has been really nice...because my freshman and sophomore year it didn't exist, and I was going through some pretty rough times, like mental health stuff, as college students often do,&rdquo; Seo said. &ldquo;And I think it was rough to think like, oh, $25 each time, I go here weekly, that's like, $100 a month...And then just thinking, &lsquo;Oh, maybe I just won't [go].&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>When considering the needs still unfulfilled for Denebs, Tillman said he wanted all Pell-eligible students to be able to study abroad at least once during their time at the University. Tillman believes that having a study abroad experience on your resume can show a certain flexibility that gives a competitive edge during the application process and noted that for some, this may be the only chance they ever get to travel abroad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fields said he would like to see a system that automatically lifts holds from low SES students&rsquo; accounts so that they can register for classes. He also hopes to see an increase in resources for books and school expenses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It concerns me that the school you're in can impact how much stress you may have getting all of the supplies you need to do the work you gotta do when it's all Washington University in St. Louis from our perspective,&rdquo; Fields said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fields also hopes for more support to be allocated to Deneb itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'd like to see us have...an upgraded and expanded space that celebrates the University's commitment to this initiative in this effort,&rdquo; Fields said. &ldquo;I'd like to see more staffing and I think that our students can benefit from having...additional people who are reaching out in different ways, are helping create things, helping manage things in different ways, can open up the opportunity for more touch and also help us develop stronger relationships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked to consider how their college experience would have been different without the founding of the Deneb STARS community, students remarked on how life at the University would have been more difficult without the feeling of community, and that Deneb helped connect them with resources that were vital for their time here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leon especially appreciates the leaders of Deneb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mentors that I got through the program have been incredible,&rdquo; Leon said. And in terms of talking to Mr. Tillman and Dr. Fields and Lucy [Chin, the Coordinator for Student Success] and all these people that support the office and Deneb, they've been incredible mentors to me throughout my college career...I think that really helped me assimilate and really feel comfortable just being myself and really letting me and my background shine at the school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the inaugural class of the program graduates this year, students had a variety of advice to give to future Deneb STARS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think just be you,&rdquo; Leon said. &ldquo;You can be you at the school. I think a lot of students like me kind of come from either these lower socioeconomic statuses or... are first generation, things like that. It's hard to really feel like &lsquo;Oh, I can do something&rsquo; or &lsquo;I can make a difference&rsquo;...because you're not coming from some of these privileges...Just don't be held back by societal constructions that form or that you think about when trying to define your own experiences.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Particularly for students still adjusting to campus, Velasco encouraged students to embrace the sense of community as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lean on the upperclassmen in the Deneb STARS community if you ever need advice&mdash;with a community of over 500 people, the odds that someone will be able to help you are really high,&rdquo; Velasco said. &ldquo;I hope that you get involved in organizations on campus that call to you, and even if the Deneb STARS community isn't your only home, remember that you can always come back when you need it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The leaders of Deneb each had their own advice to give to the class of 2020 Deneb STARS as they depart from the University and make their way in the outside world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tillman offered some encouragement in the face of life&rsquo;s uncertainty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's going to happen is that all of those feelings of doubt, uncertainty...that you felt when you were a first-year student, especially in those first couple of weeks, you're going to revisit them again...You're going into again, the unfamiliar...the sense that I have to prove myself all over again,&rdquo; Tillman said. &ldquo;And I would say, yes, you will. But you have nothing to prove to anyone but to yourself...Look at that degree as confidence, as a representation of your ability to overcome obstacles, because there are always going to be obstacles in life. But never lose your confidence that you have the ability to overcome them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fields encouraged a path of motivation and pride through remembrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't forget where you came from...Don't forget that you didn't let where you came from dictate where you can go,&rdquo; Fields said. &ldquo;And when you get where you're going, don't forget to help someone else from where you came from know they can get to similar places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even though the class of 2020 will be leaving the grounds of Washington University, the community they have found in the Deneb STARS will follow them throughout life&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been one of the greatest joys of my professional life...developing this program, developing this idea, developing this concept, seeing it come to fruition, seeing the result on a daily basis...And you all are the first graduating class so you're the first alums of the program,&rdquo; Tillman said. &ldquo;And so you know our connections with you all will not end because you earned your degree. We're going to still be reaching out to you...My charge to the class of 2020 and ensuing classes is to expect to continue to be Deneb. Once a Deneb, always a Deneb.&rdquo;</p>
