<p>Hillel estimates that approximately 24% of Washington University&rsquo;s undergraduate population is Jewish. Wash. U. is an anomaly in its high percentage of Jewish students and Midwest location. Of the nation&rsquo;s 60 most Jewish colleges, 55 are located on the coasts. However, a much smaller portion of Wash. U. &rsquo;s approximately 1,700 Jewish students identify as Orthodox&ndash; the most traditional of the religion&rsquo;s three branches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Orthodox community on campus is a close and welcoming one, senior Max Helfand of Los Angeles, Calif. says, which is something he noticed during his first visit to campus. In applying to colleges, he was seeking an academically rigorous university, with a collaborative student body and a strong religious life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to Wash. U. for a day to visit, and someone who is now a friend of mine saw me wearing a kippah. He came up to me and said &lsquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m involved in Chabad, where are you going? Do you need help finding your next place?&rsquo;&rdquo; Helfand says. &ldquo;And he walked me all the way across campus. It was something really cool that I hadn&rsquo;t seen at other schools. I felt like it was really a warm place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helfand believes his expectations of the University have been exceeded since this first visit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Junior Tani Kay, who is from Boca Raton, Fla, grew up in a religious community, attending Jewish schools, camps and a Jewish gap year program. Wash. U. was his first sustained experience in a secular environment, and he has greatly enjoyed connecting and sharing experiences with students from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed people are kind of hesitant to ask about the kippah (head covering) and the tzitzit (religious tassels worn under clothing), but I love talking about it,&rdquo; Helfand says. &ldquo;I think it makes for a really great discussion about reflecting on your values, and how what you wear can symbolize your identity and what you believe in.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love answering questions,&rdquo; Kay agrees. &ldquo;I love having discussions about religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shabbat</strong></p>
<p>For many Orthodox Jews, an essential part of keeping their religion is observing Shabbat from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday every weekend. During this time, Orthodox Jews refrain from driving, using electricity and cell phones, and doing work&ndash; instead, they attend services and enjoy meals together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Logistically speaking, some people are surprised that we use no electronic devices, no writing, nothing of that nature for a full 25 hours every single week,&rdquo; Kay says. "Some people ask if that is hard work-wise. I personally don&rsquo;t think so because humans need to rest. We are not machines, and having a scheduled rest day of the week personally helps me a lot to be ready to go on Sunday.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Helfand concurs that Shabbat is his favorite time of the week &ndash; when he can truly rest and be present with those around him. However, both acknowledge that just like any other weekly commitment, the observance of Shabbat can often conflict with other social and academic plans. Kay could think of two clubs he wanted to join but could not because they meet exclusively on Friday or Saturday afternoons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sophomore Ariel Haberman, who is from New York, NY, recalls once having a computer science final scheduled on a Saturday night. While she easily moved the exam, she notes that the daily or weekly assignments that conflict with her worship schedule generally cause more of a conflict than large, rarer events like exams. One of her classes has weekly assignments that are due at midnight on Fridays. While her friends can stay up late to finish them, she must finish working by sundown, which is often as early as 4:30 p.m.</p>
<p>In addition to academic commitments, as a member of the rugby team Haberman has run into a variety of logistical issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only felt comfortable joining because I joined with another Orthodox Jew,&rdquo; Haberman says. &ldquo;We made it clear that we can&rsquo;t play in away games or tournaments. We play at home games, because they are within walking distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Social events for the team, such as mixers with other sports teams, are usually on Friday nights. In the past, after services, she and her fellow Orthodox teammate would walk over together from Chabad to social events. However, her Orthodox teammate was abroad this semester.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to walk over from Chabad to [near the Loop] alone and without a phone,&rdquo; Haberman says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just not comfortable doing that. Because [Friday night is Shabbat], I can&rsquo;t get a ride.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Holidays</strong></p>
<p>One particularly important time of the year comes during the High Holy Days, a series of holidays that usually occur in early fall, just as midterms begin picking up for the semester. During these holidays, most Orthodox Jews abide by the rules they also use at Shabbat: not using electronics, phones and not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was two or three times last semester that I just went to class and sat there doing nothing because it was a Jewish holiday,&rdquo; Haberman says. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to miss class because then I would be screwed if I ever messed up a studio. I would automatically get a bad grade. Certain classes have things like an [absence] pass or a drop built in. Once they have that, the professor isn&rsquo;t usually as nice about it. If the class has nothing built in, they&rsquo;re usually kinder, because they will just make an exception.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kay points to the fact that while many professors formally acknowledge Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashana, two one-day holidays during this period, the eight-day festival of Sukkot that follows is less-well known. The post-holiday catch-up period can cause some additional stress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had really positive experiences with how accommodating my professors have been,&rdquo; Helfand says. &ldquo;But no matter how accommodating a professor is, I&rsquo;m still playing catch-up, sometimes up to the end of the semester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Eating kosher</strong></p>
<p>Another aspect of Orthodox Judaism is maintaining a diet that is kosher, meaning eating only food that abides by the dietary guidelines set forth in traditional Jewish law. Labeled Kosher pre-packs, such as cold sandwiches, fruit, and hummus, are available for purchase at most eateries on campus. However, the only place on campus serving hot Kosher food is the L&rsquo;Chaim station in Bear&rsquo;s Den.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For upperclassmen who no longer live on the South 40, there are no other options for finding hot, Kosher meals on campus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For lunch, some people go back to [Bear&rsquo;s Den], some people will eat pre-packs, but for dinner you want a hot meal like most people do,&rdquo; Haberman says. &ldquo;If you live in the Village or the Lofts, that means that if you only eat supervised, marked Kosher things, you have to go back to [Bear&rsquo;s Den].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of her friends have relaxed their dietary practices, eating vegan meals that are not necessarily marked prepared Kosher, or even eating dairy out. Haberman also notes that there is only one restaurant nearby that is certified kosher, Gokul, located on the Loop. Gathering socially at a restaurant can therefore pose a challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Living arrangements</strong></p>
<p>Kay, Haberman and Helfand have all lived with non-Orthodox roommates throughout their time at Wash. U. Haberman&rsquo;s freshman year roommate was a religious non-denominational Christian. She says this was a perfect pairing, and the two still live together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t that thing of, I&rsquo;m a weird Orthodox Jew, don&rsquo;t turn the lights on in the room, or whatever other things I&rsquo;ve said. I&rsquo;m just like: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to use electronics!&rsquo; and she&rsquo;s like: &lsquo;Okay, I get it!&rsquo;&rdquo; Haberman says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about what she does, what she believes in. We&rsquo;ll often have discussions about religion and faith, which I find interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, there can come challenges when sharing a space with people who adopt different and often conflicting living practices. For instance, Helfand says he was not able to keep a Kosher kitchen and prepare food in his home during his junior year living in the Lofts, located on the Loop. To get a hot meal, he would regularly bike to Bear&rsquo;s Den.</p>
<p>Additionally, access to residential halls normally relies on electronic room keys. Residential Life provides mechanical keys to get into their buildings and rooms on Shabbat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of my roommates learned a lot about what I do all the time,&rdquo; Kay says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learning more</strong></p>
<p>Both Hillel and Chabad &ndash;&nbsp;two national Jewish organizations with strong on-campus presences &ndash; plan weekly Shabbat dinners. They also rotate on who offers Shabbat lunch. Each of the organizations are eager to share Jewish practices and cultures with the wider Wash. U. community&ndash; a sentiment shared by many of the students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been offended by a question that was asked of me,&rdquo; Kay says. &ldquo;People often are scared to ask a question because they don&rsquo;t want to offend the person they&rsquo;re asking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone is welcome to be part of Jewish spaces, especially on Friday night dinners, it&rsquo;s a really welcoming space. I bring friends of mine who aren&rsquo;t Jewish all the time,&rdquo; Helfand says. &ldquo;So if you haven&rsquo;t had the experience to come to Shabbat or meet the Jewish community, hopefully you can see it before you graduate.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Her Jewish identity has always been very important to her, though she recognizes that as a reform Jew, her practice of the religion looks different from others&rsquo;. Over the past several years, she has grown close with many members of the Orthodox community on campus, and decided to report this story to share their experiences. </em></p>
