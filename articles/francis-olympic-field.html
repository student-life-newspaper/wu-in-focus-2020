<p>In the press box at halftime of the Washington University football team&rsquo;s eventual blowout loss to North Central College on Sept. 23, 2019, I watched as Chancellor Andrew Martin, surrounded by University officials and Olympic athletes, took part in the ceremony renaming Francis Field to Francis Olympic Stadium.</p>
<p>It was a moment years in the making: the product of hard work and perseverance by community members dedicated to raising awareness about the 1904 Olympics. It was clearly supposed to be a triumph. Instead, I felt tense as I watched Martin commemorate the renaming of the field.</p>
<p>The 1904 Olympics took place at Francis Field from Aug. 29 to Sept. 3 as part of a larger sports program held from July 1 to Nov. 23. They were the third modern Olympics games to be put on and the first to be held outside of Europe. The games were held in conjunction with the 1904 World&rsquo;s Fair, now infamous for their Anthropology Days, which featured Native Americans and Filipinos within a human zoo. Like many in the crowd, I didn&rsquo;t know much about the games themselves, but I knew about the fair and its legacy.</p>
<p>When the ceremony concluded, I walked down towards the field to ask Chancellor Martin about the renaming and how the University is reckoning with the complex legacy of the 1904 Olympics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say that it&rsquo;s certainly important for us to understand the history and some of the unfortunate things that happened during the 1904 Olympics here in St. Louis,&rdquo; Martin said when asked about criticism of the renaming. &ldquo;But the value that the Olympic movement has brought to this community and around the world in its over a century of legacy is something I think we should be really proud of, on balance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything being done to acknowledge that legacy?&rdquo; I asked as he started to walk away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The renaming of Francis Field is the brainchild of James Shadrach Schoenke. Schoenke, who noticed that the Olympic pride that permeates other former host cities was missing from St. Louis, began the push for the incorporation of Olympic signage into the areas where the games had been held.. In 2011, he reached out to the president of the St. Louis Sports Commission, Frank Viverito, to discuss the idea of bringing the rings to St. Louis. With the backing of the commission, particularly with the support of Michael Loynd&mdash;the chairman of the St. Louis Sports Commission&rsquo;s Olympic Legacy Committee&mdash;the process sped up.</p>
<p>For the commission&rsquo;s part, they acknowledged the complicated legacy of the 1904 Olympics and World&rsquo;s Fair, but they argue that it&rsquo;s key to contextualize the Games in history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we had two cars in the garage, one of them was a 1904 Model A Ford and the other one was a 2020 Lexus, we wouldn&rsquo;t take a look at the 1904 Model A and say, &lsquo;Oh my gosh, what a junker!&rsquo;&rdquo; Viverito said in a 2018 piece reported by former Student Life editor Rohan Gupta. &ldquo;We would look at it as such a significant and valuable piece of history, even though it didn&rsquo;t have the same&hellip;steering as the 2020 Lexus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fundamental wager of those driving the commemoration of the 1904 Olympics is that many fewer people know about those Olympics than know about the 1904 World&rsquo;s Fair. At least in my experience, that&rsquo;s a fair assumption. What I knew about the 1904 Olympics and World&rsquo;s Fair came mostly through op-eds and articles published in Student Life, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and an SB Nation video I watched in my freshman year. My knowledge of the World&rsquo;s Fair was cursory, at best&mdash;just enough to be outraged over the renaming of the field, but not enough to articulate the significance of the Fair. My knowledge of the 1904 Olympics was limited to a handful of fun facts. According to Schoenke, many people at the start of the campaign were unaware that St. Louis had ever hosted the Olympics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought there might have been some knowledge,&rdquo; Schoenke said. &ldquo;But it turns out a lot of people were really surprised, like &lsquo;No, I didn't know that.&rsquo; Basically, we were kind of starting from nothing. And there's a point where we kind of went from looking at Olympic legacy to &lsquo;We need to establish Olympic legitimacy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Susan Brownell, an anthropology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, noted that her students, many of whom are from the St. Louis area, don&rsquo;t know much about the 1904 Olympics, but they are aware of the World&rsquo;s Fair. Awareness of the fair stems in part from the ongoing presence that it maintains around St. Louis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you've been to the Missouri History Museum, they have an ongoing exhibit,&rdquo; Brownell said. &ldquo;Of course, it does have a component about the Olympic Games, but it's a small one. There's a very active World's Fair historical society that sponsors a lot of events and talks. Maybe that does help raise awareness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cultural impact that the 1904 World&rsquo;s Fair has had is equally notable. The build-up to the Fair is immortalized in the massively successful movie &ldquo;Meet Me in St. Louis.&rdquo; Cultural landmarks of the World&rsquo;s Fair are still found around St. Louis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you run into it every now and then,&rdquo; Brownell said. &ldquo;I mean, just in the popular media, things named after it. I've got the World's Fair donut shop right here where I live, you know, things like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1904, the World&rsquo;s Fair was on the main stage in St. Louis. The Olympics were a sideshow, an afterthought dragged to St. Louis from Chicago after the organizers of the World&rsquo;s Fair threatened to hold their own athletic events that would overshadow the Olympics. Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the Modern Olympic Games, once called the Olympics &ldquo;the humiliated vassal&rdquo; of World&rsquo;s Fairs. After the first modern Olympics in Athens in 1896, it wasn&rsquo;t until the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm that the Olympics were a standalone event.</p>
<p>The mission of the St. Louis Sports Commission in their efforts to revive the Olympic legacy is to elevate the St. Louis Olympics from humiliated vassal to important stepping-stone in the development of the modern Olympic movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would take a lot more pride in the Olympics and be touting that over the World's Fair,&rdquo; Loynd said. &ldquo;I couldn't tell you when the last World's Fair was or who had it or why. But you can certainly tell me when the last Olympics was, where it was and everything like that. I think we hitched our wagon to the wrong thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether there is more than one horse to hitch the wagon to is a contentious point. Some would argue that the Olympics and World&rsquo;s Fair are wrongly linked and that the 1904 Olympics&mdash;while not without its problems&mdash;was distinct from the grotesque displays of the World&rsquo;s Fair. However, that line has been blurry since before the 1904 Olympics even began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even today, there's debate about which events were actually the Olympic events, because there was a huge sports program surrounding the fair and the Olympic Games weren't very clearly separated out from them,&rdquo; Dr. Brownell said. &ldquo;Even Anthropology Days, which brought natives together who were working at the fair at the different concessions and exhibits, was called in some publicity the &lsquo;Special Olympics&rsquo; actually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still, considered separately from the World&rsquo;s Fair, the 1904 Olympics did have aspects to be proud of. It was the birthplace of multiple Olympic traditions, such as the gold medal, which was presented for the first time at the 1904 games. George Poage became the first African American to compete and medal at an Olympics, earning bronze in the 200-yard hurdle and 400-yard hurdle. Gymnast George Eyser became the first athlete with a disability to earn a medal. Quite the overachiever, Eyser earned six medals while competing with a wooden prosthetic leg.</p>
<p>While certain competitions&mdash;namely, the marathon&mdash;remain controversial, the games themselves were largely well put on. The United States was developing a professionalized and commercialized athletic culture, which led to state-of-the-art equipment and facilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Performance was important to Americans and the performances and the facilities in 1904 were top notch,&rdquo; Brownell said. &ldquo;A lot of records were broken. The gymnasium&mdash;which you have to laugh, because it's the current old wing of the Wash. U. gymnasium&mdash;in its day, it was the leading edge. And the equipment, the gymnastics apparatus, that kind of stuff: It was all just cutting edge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those innovations to the Olympics are far less known than the tragic spectacle of the World&rsquo;s Fair. That&rsquo;s what the St. Louis Sports Commission sought to change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We're just trying to highlight what really happened and try to bring a little more spotlight on the Olympics that we feel was a very positive thing for St. Louis and within the Olympic movement,&rdquo; Loynd said.</p>
<p>The geopolitical context of the 1904 Olympics contributes to its diminished legacy. The dominant European powers of the early 20th century were critical of the rising United States, which led to an increased focus on the unsavory aspects of the 1904 games. According to Brownell, critiquing the Olympics as a form of resistance against rising superpowers has not been unique to 1904.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was definitely a prejudice in Europe against the World's Fair and the Olympic Games,&rdquo; Brownell said. &ldquo;It was basically the same thing we saw against China in 2008. As a China scholar, I made that comparison. [In 1904], the US was an emerging superpower, and [existing] superpowers are never happy when a new one starts to emerge and challenge them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While geopolitics contributed to the disdain expressed by Europeans, that disdain was also driven by disgust with the 1904 World&rsquo;s Fair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The World's Fair was not highly regarded by Europeans and the games by association,&rdquo; Dr. Brownell said. &ldquo;You had the Anthropology Days associated with the games. And even though they weren't really an official part of the Olympic Games, they did tarnish games a little bit with this kind of colonialist and imperialist ideology that they expressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The effort to celebrate the 1904 Olympics is implicitly an effort to decouple the Olympics from the 1904 World&rsquo;s Fair. Rather than engage with criticism of the World&rsquo;s Fair, the organizers of St. Louis Olympic Commission have tried to sidestep the debate by pointing to the distinction between the two events. But that distinction rests on shaky ground at best. To the well-informed, the two events are so intimately linked that drawing a bright line between the events of each is a dubious task. To the average person, they are nearly indistinguishable.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Halfway through my interview with Mike Loynd, after I asked him if there was any concern about the efficacy of elevating the 1904 Olympics being undercut by not actively acknowledging the World&rsquo;s Fair, he asked me a question I didn&rsquo;t have the answer to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, I don&rsquo;t&mdash;What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I started researching for this project, I was skeptical of the St. Louis Sports Commision and their approach to the World&rsquo;s Fair. But as I wrote this article, my assessment of their method became cloudy. The Olympic committee undertook a bold project to recognize an important, forgotten aspect of St. Louis history. They unintentionally shined a light on one of the darkest events in St. Louis history. And now we&rsquo;re left with this complicated eyesore on campus, an attempt to craft something positive out of a painful history unintentionally serving to make that history more salient in our minds. So where do we go from here? Even if condemnation was called for, it wouldn&rsquo;t change the name of the stadium or remove the statue. And even if we could get rid of those markers of history, should we want to?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the debate over whether to remove confederate statues, the American History Association stated that to remove a statue "is not to erase history, but rather to alter or call attention to a previous interpretation of history.&rdquo; Is that not precisely what the St. Louis Sports Commission has done? The history of the 1904 Olympics, good or bad, was largely forgotten. Its connection to the 1904 World&rsquo;s Fair was treated as non-controversial. By drawing attention to the 1904 Olympics, the St. Louis Sports Commission has provided a chance to face that history directly. Maybe, the result of that facing that history is that we are resounding in our opposition to their commemoration. Maybe we are more amenable to it. But if we tackle this question uncritically, we wouldn&rsquo;t be brave. We would be cowards, afraid to reckon with the problematic history of Washington University and St. Louis.</p>
<p>Athletic Director Anthony Azama inherited an athletic department that was already in the process of bringing the Olympic Rings to campus. For Azama&mdash;the first African-American AD in the University Athletic Association&mdash;the Rings represent a chance to recognize past mistakes and grow in them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always look at things when it pertains to history in three areas: context, intent and progress,&rdquo; Azama said. &ldquo;How do we look at some of the errors in judgment and actions and how do we try to grow from it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We should be uncomfortable about Francis Olympic Stadium. We should be uncomfortable about the legacy that the Olympic Rings carry forward. But we shouldn&rsquo;t look away. The Olympics Rings cannot succeed in washing away the sins of the 1904 World&rsquo;s Fair. But they can spark discussion about ways that those sins can be atoned for.</p>
<p>As Azama put it. &ldquo;The beauty of sports is how it brings people together, but it also provokes dialogue and, sometimes, it helps be the catalyst for change.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
