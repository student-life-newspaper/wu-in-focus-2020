<p>I was in Paws and Go when somebody tapped me on my shoulder. I jolted, turning quickly&mdash;it was during my first few weeks at Wash. U., and I wasn&rsquo;t expecting anyone to reach out to me so familiarly. Standing before me was a Black woman, eyes alight and full of excitement. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I just love your backpack. Where did you find it? I&rsquo;d love one for my daughter.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My mind went blank. I couldn&rsquo;t for the life of me remember the name of the brand. After standing there for a few moments wracking my brain, I asked her for her name and promised that I would find her once I remembered. Five minutes later, the name came to me. I rushed back to Paws&mdash;she was nowhere to be found. Berating myself, I began writing out a note for her with the name of the brand and details on how to get the backpack. I had just finished signing my name when I caught the back of her head in the corner of my eye. I ran over to her, relief washing over me, and handed her the note. When she finished reading it, she hugged me tightly. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>It made my day. It was the kind of comfort and connection that I hadn&rsquo;t realized I needed, a thousand miles away from home for the first time. I called my mom that night and told her everything. I could hear her smile over the phone.</p>
<p>My backpack bears an illustration of a beaming Black little girl. She, too, is wearing a backpack&mdash;a purple one. A teddy bear peeks out from the largest pocket. Bantu knots stand tall on her scalp. Her baby hairs are laid flat and curled prettily. She is wearing a navy shirt that says, &ldquo;I can do anything.&rdquo; The glint in her eye dares you to think otherwise.</p>
<p>It was my mom&rsquo;s idea, of course. She found the store, she bought the bag. Before she bought it, though, she let me look through the designs and pick one that I liked. There were Black girls with box braids, space buns, high puffs and afros. Black boys with fades, dreads and hi-tops. All wearing backpacks, all declaring that they could do anything. In representation, for once, I was spoiled for choice. I knew immediately which one was mine, though&mdash;only one of them reminded me of me.</p>
<p>I first started wearing the backpack in my last year of high school. Being at a predominantly white school, many of my classmates didn&rsquo;t get it. &ldquo;Is that supposed to be you?&rdquo; someone asked. I didn&rsquo;t know what to say. &ldquo;What are those bumps on her head?&rdquo; How could I describe centuries of history in a passing phrase?</p>
<p>Most interesting, though, were comments like, &ldquo;I love your backpack&mdash;it&rsquo;s so <em>important.</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;Your bag is so <em>powerful</em>.&rdquo; Spoken by well-meaning white peers and teachers, these words sat with me. They forced me to stop and consider the weight carried within the visage of a Black child. To wear a bag that portrays a Black girl ready to go to school was not a statement of fashion but one of political intent. Rather than a girl wearing a backpack with a Black girl on the front, I was Taking A Stand On Natural Hair and Education Within The Black Community. This offered opportunities for shallow support and allyship from more &ldquo;woke&rdquo; peers and provoked silence from the indifferent. I became hyper aware of the quiet that followed when my backpack was in sight, the double-takes, the continued stares. I was calling attention to my Blackness, something taboo in my apathetic and &ldquo;color-blind&rdquo; environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was lonely. But it was also unifying. I got smiles and waves from the few Black girls in my school. A Black friend of mine told me she might buy one herself once we graduated. It was a reminder of who I am, direly needed in an environment that was nothing if not erasing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I graduated high school, my mom asked me if I wanted a new backpack for college. I told her I&rsquo;d keep my old one.</p>
<p>My few weeks of school at Wash. U., I was astounded. There were Black interest clubs, cultural shows, magazines. Classes revolving around African and African-American history; protests revolving around African and African-American injustices. Identity screamed where I had only heard it whisper. And the hair: box braids, space buns, high puffs, afros, fades, dreads, hi-tops. Black people of all shapes and sizes and colors, clad in backpacks, capable of doing anything.</p>
<p>I was still aware of my bag, still overanalyzed the stares it bought me. But I didn&rsquo;t stand out as much, or more accurately, I stood out just as much as every other Black girl did. Claiming my identity was, in my mind, less radical and more cathartic.</p>
<p>Aside from the embarrassing number of notebooks and binders making it burst at the seams, my backpack was rarely on my mind. That is, until someone tapped me on the shoulder in Paws and Go.</p>
<p>Since that first encounter, at least a dozen people have interacted with me upon seeing my backpack. A passing compliment, a quick conversation. Questions on where I got mine. A white woman chased me down in the DUC for information on where to purchase one for her Black son. Last week, I visited an elementary school and saw one of the bags hanging precariously on a cubby hook. I couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p>Previously, my bag had felt like an intrusion, a kind of defiance. Blackness is never apolitical, and knowing that, I wore my bag, constantly aware of how it would look to an outsider, to someone who didn&rsquo;t understand. It was a way of entering an acknowledgment of color into the awareness of the indifferent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had forgotten, though, why I had initially wanted the bag in the first place, why my mom had wanted it for me. Why I was excited when I saw all the options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was simply excited to see someone who looked like me. Who went to school like me. Who did her hair like mine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a feeling I identified in the voices of those who complimented my bag, who hoped to buy their own. In myself, when I felt my loneliest in high school, and when I felt most seen in the network of Black students there and at Wash. U. To be Black is to feel simultaneously invisible and <em>too </em>visible, to be unseen and intrusive when you are seen. Be it in the movie theater, or on the TV screen, or in your first few weeks in college, or even in the illustration of a Black girl with bantu knots and baby hairs: seeing a flicker of myself made me feel a little less lonely. A little more fearless. Like I could do anything.</p>
<p>I carry her with me, on my back, to remind me.</p>

As a Black girl who is used to being &ldquo;The Black Girl,&rdquo; her transition to Wash.U. and the diverse Black community it presented was a culture shock; in environments where you feel like you represent an entire population, every action feels like a statement. It&rsquo;s like carrying every member of your culture with you on your back. Her backpack, which bears the face of a smiling Black girl, made her think critically about what it means to be encouraged by people surrounded by people who share your culture, and why simply seeing a depiction of yourself can offer strength and a bit of joy.</em></p>
