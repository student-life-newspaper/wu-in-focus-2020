<p>In 1955, my grandparents were eight years old, residing in the South underneath the feigned freedom that the Jim Crow laws provided. Mygrandfather and his seven siblings sweated in the Georgian heat as their small fingers tirelessly picked away in the cotton field, a burden forced upon him beginning at the age of three. No money was given for their labor, as they were sharecroppers; your work could not be measured in the form of cash, for it amounted to nothing more than the allowance of one of life&rsquo;s basic necessities: shelter.</p>
<p>In 1955, Emmet Till was murdered for &ldquo;whistlin&rsquo; at a white woman,&rdquo; as my mother had told me for so many years, his body maimed and beaten to nothing, tossed into the depths of the Tallahatchie River where it would sink and bloat and decay for three days before being discovered. What feels like myth and tragic folklore was the reality of a life stolen in a time not too far away from this one, a story written in the blood of a young Black boy.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t something I had learned about in class; this act of violence hadn&rsquo;t made its way into my history book. Those textbooks glossed over the racist past of America, a past that had relentlessly paved the way for the present, a past that still follows in my grandparents&rsquo; shadows, a past they&rsquo;re reminded of when a hostess haphazardly seats them in the back of the restaurant. But this was their history, and mine shared, both Black and American.</p>
<p>In 2016, Donald J. Trump was elected president. I went to bed comfortably the night before, fully confident that I had lived to see the day that America had elected its first woman president. But I was wrong. The comfort I had previously rested in had now drifted away to some distant place, leaving fear in its stead. This fear was not something new or misplaced, rather, it was something already existent that was conjured up over years of being subject to the racist rhetoric that was pushed throughout the entirety of Trump&rsquo;s campaign. In the same year, in a means to win the Black vote in Michigan, Trump had said,<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/19/politics/donald-trump-african-american-voters/">&ldquo;You're living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed</a>&mdash;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/19/politics/donald-trump-african-american-voters/">what the hell do you have to lose?&rdquo;</a> The year prior, Trump claimed that<a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/6/16/8789885/donald-trump-president-shocking">"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best [sic]. They're sending people that have lots of problems. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists."</a> This is how the nation&rsquo;s president-elect viewed people of color. This is how he viewed my friends, my family, me.</p>
<p>He ran on the platform of &ldquo;Make America Great Again,&rdquo; a phrase that encapsulated the remnants of a perilous past that begged to be abandoned, all within a neat and tidy four words.The words were plastered in bold white letters upon even bolder red hats.In an<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-donald-trump-came-up-with-make-america-great-again/2017/01/17/fb6acf5e-dbf7-11e6-ad42-f3375f271c9c_story.html">interview with The Washington Post</a> in 2017 regarding his campaign slogan, Trump said, &ldquo;It actually inspired me, because to me, it meant jobs. It meant industry, and meant military strength. It meant taking care of our veterans. It meant so much.&rdquo;But did this man, this self-proclaimed<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-i-am-the-least-racist-person/2016/06/10/eac7874c-2f3a-11e6-9de3-6e6e7a14000c_story.html">&ldquo;least racist person that you&rsquo;ve ever encountered&rdquo;</a>, consider what his slogan might imply? Based on his previous racist statements&mdash;his refusal to denounce white supremacists, his recurrent stereotyping&mdash;I doubt the sentiment of his slogan, which was apparent to most Black Americans, ever even crossed his mind. &ldquo;Make America Great Again&rdquo; was and is a battle cry that wages war on the present and regresses to the past, a reference to a history of the good ol&rsquo; days of the nation that only a select few&mdash;the people who looked like him&mdash;could take part in.</p>
<p>In 2019, only 64 years after the murder of Emmett Till, I found myself in Washington, D.C. at the National Museum of African American History and Culture. I had no expectations going into the museum. I had only heard that the museum was nice, although at times it could be <em>heavy, </em>so I was told. I felt ready for the experience, ready to learn more about my own culture and background, but I wasn&rsquo;t, something I wouldn&rsquo;t know upon leaving the museum. The experience offered me something I did not expect, granted me an insight to a world I did not want to know: a glimpse into Trump&rsquo;s America.</p>
<p>We had walked through the lower level of the museum, already having endured the images of Black bodies strewn about and chained to slave ships, Ku Klux Klan images and freedom papers. I was fascinated to learn more about my ancestry and the lives lived by my predecessors on American soil, but I grew more and more emotionally exhausted upon every turn of a corner or flash of a video screen.</p>
<p>Despite knowing the outcome that was bound to ensue, I found myself waiting in a line&mdash;one that crawled up a ramp and around a segregated train car&mdash;leading to the Emmett Till memorial. We inched forward slowly, shuffling past the train car and further down the narrow path until we were stopped at the mouth of the memorial entrance. But it wasn&rsquo;t the line that had left me standing there, a momentary pause in mobility. It was something else.</p>
<p>Filing out of the memorial was a group of teens, each one wearing a name tag and the same t-shirt, presumably a group on a field trip. To complement their outfits, and to my lingering disbelief, many of the teens wore bright red hats with four words: Make America Great Again.</p>
<p>I was confused and overwhelmed. Was this supposed to be a statement? It was my turn then as the teens walked out&mdash;gentle smiles on their faces created from laughs resulting from a conversation of which I was not so privy to hear&mdash;to enter the memorial.</p>
<p>And there it was. Resting before me under smooth white light was the first casket in which Emmett Till&rsquo;s body was laid to rest. I heard the sweet, low sounds of hymnals filling the room, solemn voices crying out to a higher power. I envisioned him lying there in a suit, his swollen, deteriorating face, unrecognizable from the 14-year-old boy that he was. I saw his mother leaning over the body of her dead son, weak and crumbling beneath the agony of burying her only child. I saw a world filled with hate turning humans into monsters, men into murderers for nothing more than the ignorance to each other&rsquo;s differences and complexions. I saw MAGA hats.</p>
<p>My confusion turned to anger, turned to sadness, turned to tears. Did they know? The teens with the hats had ambled away from the memorial with the same disposition of someone who had just seen another statue in a museum, something idle and dull, trivial. All the while wearing atop their heads a bright red symbol of oppression. On their heads I saw a three-year-old boy picking cotton in the heat of the summer, a teenager being murdered for the hell of it, hundreds of Black people being told their lives meant nothing and one man who made that all okay under the guise of making America great again. What to them was nothing more than just a hat had left me in tears, unable to speak, a dark memory etched into my mind that would follow me for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>In 2020, a year after having visited the museum, Donald J. Trump is up for re-election. Lynching was just <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-poised-to-pass-historic-anti-lynching-bill-after-more-than-a-century-of-failure/2020/02/26/33df91ae-58ae-11ea-9000-f3cffee23036_story.html">made a federal hate crime</a>, 65 years after Emmett Till&rsquo;s own lynching. In my hometown, every now and then when I scroll through Facebook or when I&rsquo;m walking in a grocery store, I see those red hats. A precarious red, not like the color of blood, but rather one to send a message, a warning, a threat.</p>
<p>The teens' message to me was loud that day at the museum, no louder or any different than Trump&rsquo;s, but I did not feel threatened. I felt pain for what I had seen, sadness for what it represented, but ultimately, I felt proud. The museum revealed more than just the hardships of Blacks in America. It displayed our accomplishments despite all our triumphs in a nation that seemed to try and halt our success. I was proud to see this side of our history, this side of my history, and that sense of pride is stronger than any hatred ever will be.</p>
