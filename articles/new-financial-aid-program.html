<p>Early in October, Andrew Martin, then the newly-inaugurated chancellor of Washington University, announced the <a href="https://www.studlife.com/news/2019/10/03/martin-announces-free-tuition-for-low-income-students-in-missouri-and-southern-illinois/">WashU Pledge</a>, a promise to provide full tuition, fees and room and board to low-income students from Missouri and Southern Illinois.</p>

<p>The WashU Pledge is not the only financial aid initiative that Chancellor Martin has announced in his time at the University. Last year, Martin, still chancellor-elect, announced two grants to help incoming students that are Pell Grant eligible or belong to families with an annual income of under $75,000 prepare for college.</p>
<p>The pledge and the grants represent a concentrated effort to increase the proportion of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. In 2017, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/washington-university-in-st-louis">New York Times investigation</a> on college and socioeconomic status found that Washington University had more than three times more students from the top 1% of income-earning families than the bottom 60%. A <a href="https://www.studlife.com/wu-in-focus/doc/Trouble%20Duck%20PDF.pdf">Student Life survey</a> from last year&rsquo;s WU: In Focus found that 84.4% of Washington University students come from families earning more than $75,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Martin said that the inspiration for the WashU Pledge came from a personal commitment to increase educational access and a goal to increase the University&rsquo;s presence in the region.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to send a message to the region, here in metropolitan St. Louis, but also our neighbors in and out of state&mdash;in Missouri and Southern Illinois&mdash;that we're an institution that's committed to the success of the region, and that we wanted to make sure we're doing everything possible to attract talented undergraduate students here to Wash. U. regardless of their previous opportunity,&rdquo; Martin said.</p>
<p>The University&rsquo;s low share of low-income students is similar to its low share of local students. Many people from the St. Louis area, as well as Missouri and Southern Illinois, don&rsquo;t know what Washington University is or don&rsquo;t consider it a realistic option for college. According to the University&rsquo;s website, &ldquo;90% of undergraduates are from out of state and nearly 65% come from more than 500 miles away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Senior Lexi Jackson, from rural Missouri, and said the University wasn&rsquo;t on her radar until late in the college search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lived in Missouri all my life and I didn't know that Washington University existed. And then when I was informed about it, I didn't think that I was the type of student they'd be looking for, because I didn't see students like me at Wash. U., and I didn't see Wash. U. actively trying to recruit students in rural Missouri,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;I think knowing your audience is so important, and [so is] making it seem like a student like me is just as capable to get into Washington University as a student from Clayton High School.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Martin, the WashU Pledge is a tool to demonstrate a commitment to the region surrounding Washington University and to publicize the University&rsquo;s name more than before. Many schools in the area covered by the pledge traditionally have not sent students to the University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pledge has been a real catalyst for conversations all over the region,&rdquo; Martin said. &ldquo;I can tell you that our admissions office is getting phone calls from guidance counselors, including from rural Missouri, that we never talked to before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Assistant Provost for Student Success Anthony Tillman said that the University is &ldquo;making a very demonstrative commitment and sending a very strong message to folks all across the state of Missouri and southern regions of Illinois that if you are a high-achieving, low-income student, we want you to strongly consider Wash. U. as an option for your college career or your education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For those who may have traditionally overlooked the University, the pledge is a tangible promise that if students are admitted, they can attend.</p>
<p>But acceptance and even committing to the University is only the first step. Many low-income students face barriers beyond the cost of attendance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember stepping on campus freshman year, and realizing that I was not as prepared academically, not as prepared professionally, because my high school had such limited resources,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;I received a scholarship from Wash. U., but I still didn't know how to succeed in this space. Many of my friends from high school that went to other institutions ended up dropping out because they faced the same challenges and they just couldn't get past their first year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Programs like the Student Success Fund, the Student Union (SU) Opportunity Fund, the SU Mental Health Fund and the start-up and technology grants were established so students from low socioeconomic backgrounds could have equal access to University programming. The SU Opportunity fund, for example, allows students to attend paid events put on by SU-student groups, which makes many social events on campus accessible to students who otherwise could not afford to attend. Other organizations such as TRIO and Deneb STARS can provide more resources to low-income students.</p>
<p>Anthony Tillman&rsquo;s job is in many ways based around helping students find a community on campus. When Tillman came to Washington University, he started Deneb STARS, a program that helps low-income and first-generation college students and provides them with a community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hard part is once they are here and how do you build community?&rdquo; Tillman said. &ldquo;Community tends to be gravitational from a host of different types of factors: gender, race, religion, athlete, not athlete, private school, public school, large city, suburban, rural and income. And so I think our job is to&hellip; not allow [those communities] to have such hard rigid lines, whereby there is not a cross population [so there are] intersections of ideas and students.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Martin said that having tuition, room and board covered by a scholarship encourages low-income students to attend Wash. U., there are still disadvantages at the school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way I think about it, [providing free] tuition, room and board is necessary, but it's not sufficient. And we as a campus really need to pull together and ensure that our students that have had&hellip; limited educational opportunities previously, are able to come here and thrive,&rdquo; Martin said. &ldquo;And so investing into Deneb STARS and other types of programs to provide that support is fundamental. I'd say it would be foolish for us to put all of our resources into financial aid, and not think about the support that we're providing and... the culture that we have on the campus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin and Tillman both believe that having more students from low-socio-economic backgrounds at Wash. U. is an important step in creating a campus culture that is more welcoming to students from these backgrounds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More economic diversity on campus leads to more conversations about economic diversity and Tillman believes that encouraging dialogue is important because programs can only go so far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When there are programs discussed or put in place to support students from families from low income backgrounds, there's always something missing, right? It's always very pro forma and very procedural, without understanding that maybe this procedure which we're putting in place, creates more barriers than it helps,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think that's a cost because [many of] the individuals who are making the decisions have never lived that life.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, these conversations are simply the preface for taking action. Jackson said that WashU Pledge and the new start-up grants are good first steps to creating better opportunities for students from low-socio-economic backgrounds, but they are only the beginning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wash. U. has to recognize that there has to be more resources for students once they get on campus to succeed, and not just an opportunity to get them on campus.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
