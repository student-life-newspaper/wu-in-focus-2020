<p>Our first staff meeting for the second installment of WU: in Focus happened early in the fall semester as the campus was undergoing a series of changes. As we discussed the motivations of the issue, Washington University had opened a new arm of the grounds, the campus was transitioning to a new chancellor after more than twenty years and with it came new initiatives and programs to make the University a more equitable space. This change motivated our coverage to dig into what moment of history we as a University community were experiencing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal of WU: in Focus is to understand how identities and perspectives are interwoven to create the University community we know. When embarking on the second installment, our goal was to explore the dimensions of what made this year a year of change for Washington University and to understand how the constellation of student experiences informs these changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As student journalists for an independent newspaper, alongside our responsibilities as reporters we&rsquo;re students and experience the subjects we, as a publication, regularly report and write about in our issues. That is why I am so thrilled that every story published for this installment was volunteered by the reporter themselves and represents a facet of their interests as not just a member of Student Life, but as a member of this University community. Every story published was proposed, researched, reported and written out of an organic interest and belief that this subject is relevant to the student experience of our campus. That is why you will also find beneath each story there is a brief biography of the reporter or writer along with why they chose to pursue the story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite how most of our University community is now scattered across time zones over the world, we hope these stories explore the student experiences of Washington University. No matter where you are, welcome to WU: in Focus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warmly,</p>
